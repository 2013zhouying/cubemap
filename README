This "renders" the 6 faces of a cube from a panorama input image. 

Usefull if you want to tile your panorama onto a 3D cube for viewing.

Basically, translates each point from each face which is a plane in cartesian
coordinates into spherical coordinates and then gets the pixel value from the
image.
